# cypress-mochawesome-to-mysql
Lab to transform the report data generated by cypress into a mySQL database. The database can later be read by grafana

## Getting Started

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run cy:run` to create **cypress** structure
3. configure `.env` file or process.env with your mySQL parameters
    - DB_HOSTNAME
    - DB_USERNAME
    - DB_PASSWORD
    - DB_NAME
4. `npm run setup` to create data structure on mySQL instance
5. It's time to write some tests 💪🏻🧪, I left a few examples in the `./cypress/integration` folder
6. `npm run cy:run` again to run the tests
7. `npm run report` to merge the mochawesome reports
8. `npm run extract` to load results on mySQL database
9. Party time 🥳


This project was written in conjunction with [this article](https://4future.com.br/index.php/2022/05/16/lab-convertendo-relatorio-do-cypress-para-mysql/) on 4future blog.

## Considerations

For more effective control, you can also split this project into two parts

- One to set up the database and process the mochawesome report
- And another exclusively to run cypress
