# cypress-mochawesome-to-mysql
Lab to transform the report data generated by cypress into a mySQL database. The database can later be read by grafana

## Getting Started

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run cy:run` to create **cypress** structure
3. configure `.env` file or process.env with these parameters
    - DB_HOSTNAME
    - DB_USERNAME
    - DB_PASSWORD
    - DB_NAME
4. run `node config`
5. It's time to write some tests 💪🏻🧪, I left a few examples in the `./cypress/integration` folder

## Considerations

For more effective control, you can also split this project into two parts

- One to set up the database and process the mochawesome report
- And another exclusively to run cypress
